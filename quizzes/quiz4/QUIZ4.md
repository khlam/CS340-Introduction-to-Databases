### Question 1


Find the number of Certifications held by People grouped by a Planet.
Using the BSG database described in this Quiz's description, find the number of Certifications held by People grouped by a Planet.
This should have two columns:

    "name" will be the names of planets that have at least one certification.
    "CertCount" which will be the number of certifications held by people from that planet

Order your results by planet name in ascending order. Example: If Lee is certified in "Viper" and "Mechanic" and Kara is certified in "Viper" and they are both from Caprica, then the "CertCount" for the planet Caprica should be 3.
